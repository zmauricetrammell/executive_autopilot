**Executive Autopilot**

Executive disfunction assistive program designed to record and manage the execution of routines.

**Motivation:**

Many neurodivergent patterns like ADHD or Autism exhibit executive disfunction, which disrupts a person's ability to manage their own thoughts, emotions, and actions. This leaves many people struggling to complete basic routines and tasks like washing the dishes, taking out the trash, brushing their teeth. For these routine tasks, the order matters and the motivation to start is critical to the execution. 

This project is an attempt at outsourcing the executive function to an assistive tool that will guide the user through a predefined routine to overcome distraction, confusion, and low motivation.

**Concept:**

This project allows users to use RFID tag "beacons" to designate physical locations that correspond to tasks. Then the user will record sequences of tasks and specific actions to create routines. The user interface will guide the user through the desired routine by prompting the user to scan each of the beacons corresponding to the recorded actions, preventing distraction or confusion and enforcing completion.
